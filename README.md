# Pulsars identification using machine learning methods
The goal of this project was to search for the optimal supervised learning algorithm that is able to classify a real pulsar among the HTRU2 [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2).

This project has five supervised algorithms:
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Bagging Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machines
- K-nearest Neighbor Classifier

HTRU2 dataset is described by 8 continuous variables, and a single class variable.

1. Mean of the integrated profile.
2. Standard deviation of the integrated profile.
3. Excess kurtosis of the integrated profile.
4. Skewness of the integrated profile.
5. Mean of the DM-SNR curve.
6. Standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve.
7. Excess kurtosis of the DM-SNR curve.
8. Skewness of the DM-SNR curve.
9. Class

In folder Thesis there is mine engineering thesis in Polish language.
